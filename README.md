Project name: Audio transcriber


Story behind the project: 

Right now, for the work I need to transcribe videos longer than 30 minutes, with more than 30GB weight.
Most of the online free transcribers don't allow to upload files bigger than 3.7GB, so I had to come up with my own
transcriber to not complete the job manually. Essentially, this project solves the problem in 2 ways:

1. I don't need to listen and retype text manually (which saves me 10s of hours)

2. If I don't want to wait for text to be processed with my slow computer CPU, I can quickly turn the file into .wav
and upload it into the online transcriber (because apparently it accepts .wav files of such size...)


Objective: 

Create a transcriber that will:

1. Turn .mp4 file into .wav

2. Transcribe text from the video
